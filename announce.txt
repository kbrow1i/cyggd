GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images
by programmers.  GD creates PNG, JPEG and GIF images, among other
formats. GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails,
and most anything else, on the fly. While not restricted to use on the
web, the most common applications of GD involve web site development.

This is a rebuild of the 2.2.5-1 release, with some bug fixes.
